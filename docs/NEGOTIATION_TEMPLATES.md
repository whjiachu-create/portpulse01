## A. AIS Source (Spire / Kpler/MarineTraffic) — PoC Request
Subject: PortPulse – Request for a limited-scope AIS data PoC (50 ports)

Hi <Name/Team>,

We’re preparing our Public Beta and seek a limited-scope PoC with your AIS/port events data.

Scope (30–60 days):
- Port list: ~50 priority ports (US LAX/NYNJ, SG SIN, EU RTM/ANR/HAM, …)
- Rights: compute and commercialize **derivative congestion metrics** (no raw redistribution)
- API: prod-like throttling; hourly–15 min updates; history backfill if available
- Commercials: PoC fee creditable against annual contract; clear scale-up path

Open to a 30-min call this week?

Best,  
CTO @ PortPulse

## B. Product Congestion API (Portcast) — Calibration/Content
Subject: PortPulse – Port congestion API sampling & content partnership

Hi <Name/Team>,

We’d like limited data access for method calibration & sanity checks, and a content partnership (we cite dashboard snapshots with attribution).

- Limited overlapping ports (10–20)  
- Attribution on Docs/Blog; **no raw redistribution** (only our derivatives)

Quick call to align?

Thanks,  
CTO @ PortPulse
