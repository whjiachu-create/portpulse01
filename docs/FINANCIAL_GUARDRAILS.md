# Financial Guardrails

- Target **≥70% gross margin**. Data+cloud ≤35% of MRR (≤40% early stage).
- **Auto-upgrade** on overage (no pay-per-call in v1).
- Add ports only if **new MRR ≥ 3× monthly marginal data cost** of those ports.
- Edge cache + ETag/304; supplier API usage sits in **ETL**, not public endpoints.
- Yearly: charge **10× monthly** (pay 12 months), improve cash flow.
